Okay, I hope I'm not overusing the Pokemon API and you all still find it funny.

For each new student, assign them a random pokemon companion.

First, rails g migration add_pokemon

add a column to the students table

add_column :students, :pokemon, :string

run the migration.

Now, when you add a new student, get a random pokemon name and then write that pokemon's name to the student table.

You will need to install the httparty gem.

To do that, add gem 'httparty' to your gemfile and run bundle install.

Gems are libraries or plugins that you can use to have access to more functionality in your app.

number = rand(1..500)
response = HTTParty.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/#{number}")
body = JSON.parse(response.body)
name = body["name"]

Display each student's pokemon in the web page.

ALSO:

Add a migration for a lucky_number column. Give each student a "lucky_number" - a random number from 1-100 - and display that in the UI. UI means user interface aka the web page

Add a migration for a date column type :birthday - assign each student a random birthday (sorry not a real birthday haha) when they are created

You can do that this way - rand(1..365).days.ago

Experiment with formatting the displayed date somehow:
