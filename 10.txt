Redo the previous assignment - with the student names - so that the keys of the values in the students session hash are the student's names.
Use strings.

session[:students] =  { "mark" => { hobby: "soccer", favorite_food: "pizza"}, "aaron" => {hobby: "music", favorite_food: "bacon"} }

Now, we're going to create a "show" page. 

Add a route

get "students/show/:name" => "pages#show"

Add the show method and view.

def show
end

views/pages/show

Here, the colon variable is a variable that is passed into the controller method and the view under the key :name.

Called a URL parameter.

params[:name]

So now, use the params[:name] to read that student's information from the session[:students] hash. Print it onto the new page.

<%= session[:students][params[:name]][:hobby] %>
<%= session[:students][params[:name]][:favorite_food] %>

Add a link back to the main page on the show page.

<a href="/">Back to all students</a>

After you've got this working, add a new field to the form - something like "favorite_band", "home_town", or whatever and then save/display that as well.
