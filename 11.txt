Time to add a database!

Instead of a session variable, let's use a database.

Rails g migration create_students

This creates a migration file.

Edit the migration file:

    create_table :students do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :hobby
      t.timestamps
    end

    run the migration with rake db:create (creates DB) and rake db:migrate (runs migration/adds table)

Now, instead of writing new students to a session variable, write them to the DB.

Two ways to do this - 

student = Student.new(name: params[:name], hobby: params[:hobby])
student.save

Student.create(name: params[:name], hobby: params[:hobby])

This writes a row to the database.

Query for all students in the database with Student.all

pass a controller variable to the view by using an @ sign

@students = Student.all

Display these in the same way on the web page.


Open your rails console

Here, you can interact with your rails app from the command line.

Add some test students from the console:

Student.create(name: "aaron", hobby: "music")

Two more things to add to the app

On the main student page, show the current student count. Can be queried with Student.count .

Also, display the newest student - can be queried with Student.last
