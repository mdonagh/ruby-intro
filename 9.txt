OK, now that you've learned how to create forms.

Let's imitate a database.

Create a new rails app. Create a root page at pages/main in the same way, with a pages controller.

Initialize the session variable session[:students] the same was as in the last assignment. Create it as an array or a hash (your preference)

Add a form on pages/main with "name" and "hobby" text inputs.

When the user fills out the form, you should add a student to session[:students] with the user input.

if an array, push adds an element to the array

session[:students].push({name: "Geo", hobby: "Ruby"})

If a hash

session[:students][session[:students].length] = {name: "Geo", hobby: "Ruby"}


Add a controller method/route for the form, something like post "/add" routing to pages#add

Then, below the form, print session[:students]

array: 
session[:students] = [{name: "mark", hobby: "hiking"}, {name: "aaron", hobby: "music"}]

hash:
session[:students] = { 1: {name: "mark", hobby: "hiking"}, 2: {name: "aaron", hobby: "music"} }

So depending on how you STRUCTURE THE DATA USING A DATA STRUCTURE, your code will look a little different.

Then, iterate over the students in your pages/main and display the created students. Probably will look something like this:

<% session[:students].each do |student| %>
Name: <%= student[:name] %>
Hobby: <%= student[:hobby] %>
<% end %>

There is a limit on the length of the session variable so this will probably freeze eventually, don't worry about it.
