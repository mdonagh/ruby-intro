Add a delete student button on each row next to the student's information

In REST API's, deleting something should be a delete request.

So what we do is get the student's ID, create a form with a hidden input containing the student's ID, create a controller method under "/delete" (don't worry about using an ID param), and then run delete.

 <form action="/students" method="delete">
  <%= hidden_field_tag :authenticity_token, form_authenticity_token -%>
  <%= hidden_field_tag :id, student.id -%>
</form> 

add a controller method "destroy"

Destroy a student with Student.find(params[:id]).destroy
