HTTP requests with Ruby

https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty

Install this gem and require it in your file.

Use it like this:

response = HTTParty.get('http://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?site=stackoverflow')
puts response

options = {
  body: {
    pear: { # your resource
      foo: '123', # your columns/data
      bar: 'second',
      baz: 'last thing'
    }
  }
}

puts response
response HTTParty.post('/pears.xml', options)

Write HTTP requests which will send the following requests to webhook.site and then take a screenshot of the received requests

a GET request

A POST request with the parameters my_name: 'Mark', my_hobby: "Soccer"

a POST request - with the parameter - current_time: Time.now

Time is really easy to work with in IN RAILS so use a RAILS CONSOLE for the below. To do that, run "rails c" from the directory
Of a rails app

five_days_ago: 5.days.ago

one_year_ago: 1.year.ago

two_years_from_now: 2.years.from_now

Send all of the above to webhook.site
